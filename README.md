## [MEMORY+](https://memory-plus.herokuapp.com/)

Memory+ is my first application I've built that uses WebSocket techonolgies. The game resembles the board game 'Memory', but with a slight twist. Instead of matching pictures, the users will be trying to match Q/A based pairs. This adds an extra layer of difficulty to the normal 'Memory' game, because the user must now be able correctly identify an answer to a question, and remember the location to both the Q&A. 

The idea of this app came from mixing 'Kahoot' and 'Memory'. Much like Kahoot, the 'admin' user (Player A) is able to create questions and answers (FUTURE), as well as generate a game token. When another player (Player B)uses the game token they are immediately joined into a game and the cards for the game are distrubed to begin the game.
